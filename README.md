# SerialHID
Some code to expore interesting old Human Interface Devices from before the era of USB.
They all have serial (RS-232) connections and some of them are powered that way too.

## Mice and Trackballs ##

Many early PC mice were connected via RS-232.
Trackballs were interfaced that way as well.

## Joysticks ##

Some force-feedback joysticks were connected via serial because the original PC game
port was input-only (analog pots and buttons).
The force-feedback motors need much more powwer than RS-232 can supply, so these devices
have external power supplies.
Some joysticks were serial, such as the Logitech Wingman Force Feedback,
whereas the Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback used the MIDI port included in
later versions of the PC game port.

## Spaceballs ##

The Spaceball was originally a serial device for use with very expensive 3D graphics
workstations, so it had an RS-232 interface.
The device was badged by several manufacturers, including HP, Logitech and IBM.
The Spaceball 4000 FLX was serial, whereas the 5000 is a USB device.
Older models like the Logitech Magellan were also serial.

## Dialboxes ##

A real rarity, the dialbox was an early computer graphics input device consisting of
a row of pots in a box.
IBM had one that used a serial interface (IBM 6094-010), also branded by Sun
(370-1223-01) and SGI (9980992)
Possibly all these were variants of the Danaher DLS80-1022.

## Graphics Tablets ##

Many early graphics tablets (or digitising tablets) were serial,
but companies continued to make them into the early 2000s for
people who didn't yet have USB on their computers.
But the big advantage of USB was that it supplies power,
and did away with the need for a special 9-pin connector with a
power connector on the back.
Can we find the serial protocols for these old tablets?
I have a Wacom GD-1212-R, where '1212' represents the size (12 inches
square) and 'R' means RS-232.

## Any Others? ##

We can buy USB-interface flight control yokes and throttle quadrants.
Were these gadgets ever made for serial?
What about car-style steering wheels and pedals,
which are common game console controllers?

What other weird HID gadgets were made for RS-232?
