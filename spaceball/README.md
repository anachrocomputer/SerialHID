# spaceball
Some code to read data packets from serial-interfaced spaceballs.

## The Spaceball 4000 FLX ##

My first spaceball was made by Spacetec,
although the same design was sold by other vendors and I think the
company was bought by Logitech.

## Any Others? ##

Were there any other Spaceball serial protocols?
