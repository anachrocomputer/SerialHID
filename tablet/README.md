# Graphics Tablets #

Many early graphics tablets (or digitising tablets) were serial,
but companies continued to make them into the early 2000s for
people who didn't yet have USB on their computers.
But the big advantage of USB was that it supplies power,
and did away with the need for a special 9-pin connector with a
power connector on the back.
Can we find the serial protocols for these old tablets?

I have a Wacom GD-1212-R, where '1212' represents the size
(12 inches square) and 'R' means RS-232.
Then there's the UD-1218-R which is even bigger.
I've also more recently acquired a Wacom CT-0405-R PenPartner.

The Wacom IV protocol is described here:
